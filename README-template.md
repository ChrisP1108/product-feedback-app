### What I learned

One of the big things that I learned in tackling this project was the use of the Vue.JS framework.  After doing several coding project with React.JS, I decided to try my next coding challenge with a different framework for the first time and I will say...I'm liking Vue better than React.  It's Vuex state management is much easier than React Redux and it forces you to keep your code more organized without being overly strict and keeping things simple at the same time.

I also implemented new strategies with CSS styling, such as margin-left and margin-right being defined in percentages for desktop to make it better responsive to ultra wide screen monitors, so that the inner containers would not become overly stretched on those wider resolutions.

I also learned more about JSON data management, especially given that the JSON data have arrays that had arrays inside of some of its odject keys, so array methods such as for, forEach, findIndex, and splice became an important factor in adding, updating, and deleting data.


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) - This helped me to reference various Javascript array methods, such as findIndex, includes, for, forEach, splice.
